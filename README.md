Hello everyone, I'm Min student from the Faculty of ICT of Mahidol University. I always passionate about how computers work and each application works. Since I was a child, I always loved to play computer games and traverse around the world of the internet and wondering how such things exist in the computer world. Therefore, I went all out to study programming to be the programmer. I'm aiming to attend the software engineering track and graduated from the Faculty of Information and communication technology, Mahidol University within 2023. I am currently learning in online courses related to the computer and coding including Google IT Support and FutureSkill Unity 3D game application. Moreover, I am also working on weekly challenge in LeetCode to improve my data structure and algorithms skill.
